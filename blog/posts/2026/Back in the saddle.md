Two years without updates. What?!

In my defense, a lot has happened[^1]. The most important update is that I am now the proud human of Nilo, a wonderful Labradoodle who has taken over my life in the best way possible. He's intelligent, ridiculously fluffy, and has more energy than I've ever had in my entire existence combined.

Writing this while he's asleep at my feet, which I'm told is a very Labradoodle thing to do.

## tech stack updates

Since I last wrote about this site, quite a bit has changed under the hood. I'm still hosting on GitHub, but the actual site has evolved.

The biggest is that I am now using Claude Code to actually help me with Javascript. I had such problems before with something that wasn't super basic, but now things are much easier. 

Here are the changes:

* **GSAP animations** - I've added scroll animations using GSAP and ScrollTrigger. Because sometimes you just need things to fade in smoothly as you scroll, you know?
* **Cloudflare** - Moved away from it to just GitHub
* **Markdown-based blog** - No more HTML files for blog posts! Everything is now in Markdown, which makes writing *much* more pleasant
* **Magnetic navigation** - The nav links now have this subtle magnetic effect when you hover near them. It's one of those small details that nobody notices but makes me happy
* **Dark mode** - Finally implemented proper dark mode with system preference detection and localStorage persistence

The filter system for blog posts has been completely rewritten as well. The old jQuery code was ... fine. Sometimes. The new version actually works properly and handles multiple tags without glitching out.

I've also moved away from Publii entirely. Everything is now custom-built, which gives me complete control but also means I have no one to blame but myself when things break. (They haven't broken yet, knock on wood[^2] .)

## what's next

I'd like to write more this year. Nilo seems to think I spend too much time in front of the computer anyway, so maybe forcing myself to write about non-technical things will help.

Or maybe I'll just post more photos of him. You never know.[^3]

Thanks for reading. ❤️
