# As of 01 May

***

There has been some changes to the site since I last wrote.
By this I mean that almost everything has changed.

## changelog

*   the main site and blog have been fully integrated into designsaga.se (my main website) 
*   occasionalposts.com redirects to designsaga.se/blog/
*   the entire thing is now hosted on github and served using cloudflare
*   all code is now 100% written by hand (I previously used some bootstrap templates for designsaga and used publii for occasionalposts)
*   there is now a way to filter posts that you are looking for (all three of them)
*   small animations (such as for the refresh switch and darkmode toggle)
*   optimism that things are finally complete
*   Javascript tweaks all around
