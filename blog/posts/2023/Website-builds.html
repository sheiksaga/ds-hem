<p>Hey there! In my last post, I mentioned that I was using <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> to publish my posts, storing them on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and deploying them with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. I had a few reasons for doing this:</p>
<ul class="posts">
<li>First off, I wanted to cut down on the hosting costs for my blog<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. That’s why I decided to make it public on GitHub and deploy it with Cloudflare<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I also wanted to move away from WordPress and use a headless CMS where I had complete control over my posts.</li>
<li>I really like writing in Markdown!</li>
<li>And last but not least, I wanted full control over everything on my site - from the design to the formatting.</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, everything was going great. But then I started having trouble with the theming. Publii uses a theming format called Handlebars<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> and its own taxonomy for posts. And even though I had Publii and GitHub all set up, I still felt like I didn’t have as much control over my site as I wanted. Don’t get me wrong - Publii is great if you just want to write posts and publish them without worrying about how they’ll look. But I wanted more.</p>
<p>So I decided to start over from scratch. I got <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> (which is amazing, by the way) and started with a basic HTML5 template. I’ll write more about how I built the site in a future post.</p>
<p>As of 25/03/2023, here’s where things stand:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2023/homepage_250323.png" class="blog-img" alt="view of homepage as on 25.03.23"></p>
<p>There are still a few things missing (like the dark mode toggle not working quite right) and some other fixes I need to make. But for the most part, everything is working great.</p>
<p>I’m still storing the site on GitHub Pages and deploying it with Cloudflare. But now, I have complete control over how my blog looks and feels. It takes a little longer to publish a post (since I write in Markdown and then have to convert it to HTML), but it’s worth it. All in all, I’m really happy with how everything turned out!</p>

<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>The choice of Cloudflare was a convenience one. I use it as my DNS manager, so less sites to keep track of.
